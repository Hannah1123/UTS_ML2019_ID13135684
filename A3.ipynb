        "The term 'collaborative filtering-based recommendation' refers to a collective effort to filter out iterms that are not of interest to the user. Its realization process is for a particular user to find the users with similar interests of other users, and then recommending their interests to the user.\n",
        "The implementation of recommendation system based on collaborative filtering algorithms can be divided into two categories: one is memory-based collaborative filtering, and the other is model-based collaborative filtering. Among them, the model-based collaborative filtering recommendation system combines recommendation systems with machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of the recommendation. For now, there are many literatures and applications about model-based collaborative filtering recommendation systems. Deep learning algorithms are applied to model-based collaborative filtering recommendation systems to improve the accuracy of recommendation. The interaction between deep learning and recomender system shows great potential for improving recommendation systems.  \n",
        "In recent studies, there are a number of related research. Wang et al.(2015) have present the success of applying deep learning to the content information and collaborative filtering. Hidasi et al.(2016) firstly apply recurrent nueral network(RNN) to session-based recommendation. Covington et al. (2016) established a deep neural networks for Youtube recommendations which shows the high effeciency in the result. Zhao et al. (2017) addressed recurrent nueral network(RNN) to collaborative filtering for achieving high recommendation quality in Top-N recommendation system.Wu et al.(2019) apply graph neural networks for  which improve the performance.  \n",
